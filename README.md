# Verifiable Reed-Solomon Encoding (VRS)

This repository contains implementations and benchmarks of various verifiable RS encoding schemes, which are commonly used in [Verifiable Information Dispersal (VID)](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2024-08-08-vid/), [Data Availability Sampling](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/das) (DAS), and sometimes [Verifiable Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_secret_sharing) (VSS).

## Get Started
